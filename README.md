# 💡 Philosophy

I don't create things for **$$**, I create it for the experience. Been that way since **2014**!  
There's always something new to learn, and never believe you've mastered something.  
**Never** have an ego in development, because there's always someone better than you!

**Anything** I release has been released only because:
1. The time for holding onto certain projects has lost its shine or was only relevant during that time frame
2. Made something far better and what you're looking at were pretty much temporary / scrap versions (lol)
3. It may come in useful to you regardless of the time frame and/or relevance
4. Not worth gatekeeping even if you're just a muppet

You will never find projects that require high maintenance / constant updates. Fuck that, what am I - an idiot?

## 🚫 To All the Skids, Leechers, and Incompetent Retards looking to contact me:

- I am **not** your teacher, so don't expect me to hold your hand or help you in any way.
- I am **not** your friend, nor will I ever be.
- Most stuff you're looking for here will not be of help to you. **Your IQ is too low for this!**
- Get ignored 🤷

## 👨‍💻 To All My Fellow Real Developers:

- **Don't expect** me to drop things on a regular basis.
- Sometimes, I will drop resources to help reduce the time needed to research/find. They may be useful or not, it varies per person.
- To those who have a good understanding of development, you can expect:
  - Templates
  - Libraries
  - Files
  - Bits of code to learn from or expand on, etc.
  
  **Note**: Depending on when you view these codes, they may become outdated, obsolete, etc.
  
- **Expect** certain things not to have any info written in them. You're already smart enough, so I shouldn't need to explain! 😎  
- You're more than welcome to ask for help on complicated codes, but **don't expect a direct answer!** Anything that is easy to figure out will be **ignored!**

### 🚫 **Important**: I will **not** assist you with projects or tasks that may be illegal or harmful to others, including but not limited to:
- **Botnets**
- **IP/Token grabbing**
- **Doxing**
- **Malware**  
and so on...

# 🎮 Basic C++ Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

int main() {
    uint8_t num = 256;
    std::cout << "Number: " << (int)num << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Your question:** I keep getting `Number: 0` instead of `Number: 256` and I can't seem to figure out why.

**My Response:** What kind of datatype is `num`?
